#### Here is an instance of my Skeleton class so you can get a better feel for how much I think these READMEs are the death of programming üòÄ
```typescript
export default class Skeleton extends HumanThing {

  // keep those privates
  private pronouns: Yes;
  
  // I need at least two javascript frameworks to run my blog site.
  // TODO: Reduce dep tree from 10k node packages to 9.9k
  private frontEndFrameworks: Bloat;
  
  // Expose publically :(
  public webStackExperience: unknown[];
  
  // Yea, I mean we all have it *right guys?* right?
  private imposterSyndrome: Anxiety[];
  
  // Ouch
  private personalGoal: null | string;
  
  // TODO: Refactor Shitposts
  private myProjects: Shitposts;
  
  public constructor() {
    // If you misgender me I'll be quite sad.
    this.pronouns = ['Skeleton', 'Skellington', 'Uncle Fred', 'Jerome Powell']
    // Oh right this array is literally endless because thats the state of Web Dev in 2020 #ThanksRecruiters
    this.webStackExperience = ['AWS', 'JS/TS Frontend(React, Vue)', 'JS/TS Backend(Express, Next)', 'HTML/CSS', 'CI/CD', 'Serverless', 'Docker & Kubernetes', ...]
    
    this.imposterSyndrome = ['no', 'no', 'definitely not']
    
    this.personalGoal = 'Stop reading documentation and have GPT3 eventually take my job'
    
    this.myProjects = new Shitposts()
    
    // Like seriously? Why do people put this on their profile.
    this.myArchitecture = new RandomBuzzWords()
    
  }
  
  // This method is the key to success for all web devs
  // Note: What is flexbox?
  private async _findOutHowToMiddleAlignDivsOnBothAxis(): Promise<WillToProgram> {
    const dayAtWork = await googleResultsForAllMyProblems()
    return stackOverflowTopic.close('Duplicate Topic)
  }
  
  // I should have been a doctor.
  public contemplateMyCareerChoice(): string {
    return 'You made the right choice, probably? Idk'
  }
}
```

### This is code that somehow represents who I am as a person. Thank you for watching my commentary on the blight that are these READMEs.
