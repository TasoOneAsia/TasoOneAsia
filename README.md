### Hi there üëã. I'm an actual fucking skeleton. Kind of crazy when you think about it üíÄ.

**Professional Experience:**

>*Software Engineer @ Amish Settlement #3 (Not #2, stop asking)*

>*React/Angular Consultant (Emphasis on Angular.js) @ Really Basic Design Consultancy LLC*

#### Here is an instance of my Skeleton class so you can get a better feel for how much I think these READMEs are the death of programming üòÄ
```typescript
export default class BasicAssSkeleton extends DumbHuman {

  // Private distinction is key
  private pronouns: yes;
  
  // Subtle commentary right here
  private frontEndFrameworks: Bloat;
  
  // Make this public for all the haters.
  public webStackExperience: undefined[];
  
  // Yea, I mean we all have it *right guys?* right?
  private imposterSyndrome: Anxiety;
  
  // Ouch
  private personalGoal: null;
  
  // TODO: Refactor Shitposts
  private myProjects: Shitposts[];
  
  public constructor() {
    // If you misgender me I'll be quite sad.
    this.pronouns = ['Skeleton', 'Skellington', 'Uncle Fred', 'Jerome Powell']
    // Oh right this array is literally endless because thats the state of Web Dev in 2020 #ThanksRecruiters
    this.webStackExperience = ['AWS', 'JS/TS Frontend(React, Vue)', 'JS/TS Backend(Express, Next) 'HTML/CSS', 'CI/CD', 'Serverless', 'Docker & Kubernetes', ...]
    
    this.imposterSyndrome = 'no'
    
    this.personalGoal = 'Stop reading documentation and have GPT3 eventually take my job'
    
    this.myProjects = new Shitposts()
    
    // Like seriously? Why do people put this on their profile.
    this.myArchitecture = new RandomBuzzWords()
    
  }
  
  // This function has been a hard one to crack for years now üòî
  private async _findOutHowToMiddleAlignDivsOnBothAxis(): Promise<WillToProgram> {
    const dayAtWork = await googleResultsForAllMyProblems()
    return stackOverflowTopic.close('Repeat Topic)
  }
  
  // I should have been a doctor.
  private _contemplateMyCareerChoice(): string {
    return 'You made the right choice, probably? Idk'
  }
}
```

### Well thats a short teaser of the amazing class that is me üòÄ. Thank you for watching my commentary on the blight that are these READMEs.

Make sure you watch for commits to this beautiful repo üòä for even higher quality READMEs

*Oh right almost forgot the useless image embed as well* ü§¶‚Äç
